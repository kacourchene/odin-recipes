<h2 style="text-align:center;">Crisp-Skinned Spatchcocked (Butterflied) Roast Turkey With Gravy</h2>

<p>This is a recipe for a spatchcocked, roasted turkey. This recipe is from J. Kenji Lopez-Alt with Serious Eats. 
    Spatchcoking turkey cooks more quickly and evenly than traditional turkey cooking methods. The meat tends to be more 
    tender and the skin crisper than other cooking methods as well. This recipe also includes a recipe for gravy, which 
    will be made using parts and drippings from the turkey.

<h4>Ingredients</h4> 
<ul>
    <li>3 large onions, roughly chopped (about 1 1/2 quarts)</li>
    <li>3 large carrots, peeeled and roughly chopped (about 1 quart)</li>
    <li>4 stalks celery, roughly chopped (about 1 quart)</li>
    <li>12 tyhme sprigs</li>
    <li>1 whole turkey (12 to 14 pounds total), butterflied with backbone, neck, and giblets reserved</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 1/2 quarts low-sodium homemade or store-bought chicken or turkey broth</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butterflied</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet or broiler pan with aluminum foil. 
        Scatter 2/3rds of onions, carrots, celery and thyme sprigs across bottom of pan. Place slotted broiler rack or wire rack 
        directly on top of vegetables.</li>
    <li>Pat turkey dry with paper towels and rub on all surfaces with 1 tablespoon oil. Season liberally on all surfaces with salt and black pepper. 
        (If using a brined, salted, or Kosher turkey, omit salting step;) Tuck wing tips behind back. Place turkey on top of rack, 
        arranging so that it does not overlap the edges, pressing down on the breast bone to flatten the breasts slightly.</li>
    <li>Transfer turkey to oven and roast, rotating occasionally, until an instant read thermometer inserted into the deepest part of the breast 
        registers 150°F, and the thighs register at least 165°F, about 80 minutes. </li>
    <li>While turkey roasts, make the gravy. Roughly chop the neck, backbone, and giblets. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a 3-quart saucepan 
        over high heat until shimmering. Add chopped turkey parts and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. 
        Add remaining onions, carrots, and celery and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables start to soften and brown in spots, 
        another 5 minutes. Add chicken or turkey stock, remaining thyme, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and reduce to a bare simmer. Allow to cook 
        45 minutes, then strain through a fine mesh strainer into a 2-quart liquid measuring cup and discard solids. Skim off any fat from the 
        surface of the broth.</li>
    <li>Melt butter over medium-high heat in a 2-quart saucepan. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly until flour is golden brown, about 3 minutes. 
        Whisking constantly, add broth in a thin, steady stream until it is all incorporated. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until 
        reduced to about 1 quart, about 20 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper, cover, and keep gravy warm.</li>
    <li>When turkey is cooked, remove from oven and transfer rack to a new baking sheet. Allow to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before carving. 
        Carefully pour any collected juices from out of the roasting pan through a fine-mesh strainer into a liquid measuring cup. Skim off excess fat 
        and discard. Whisk juices into gravy.</li>
    <li>Carve turkey and serve with gravy.</li>
</ol>
