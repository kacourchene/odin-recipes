<h2>Chef John's Sweet Potato Casserole</h2>

<p>This is a recipe for sweet potato casserole by YouTuber, Chef John. This is a recipe that includes less sugar than most southern, sweet potato recipes 
    because he uses maple syrup instead of sugar for sweetening. This recipe also uses pistachios for a topping.
